direct control in 1984
passive control in BNW (scarier)

1984 winston knows right from wrong
people are really kinda stupid in bnw
politically wise
people dont **try** to fight back in bnw
people **cant** in 1984

conditioning in bnw is kinda like propoganda
instead of just being hammered in as true like in 1984

we dont have the perspective of the lower classes in bnw

escapism in bnw and 1984

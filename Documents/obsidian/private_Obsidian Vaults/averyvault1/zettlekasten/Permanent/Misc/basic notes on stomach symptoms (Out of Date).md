i have been having on and off abdominal pain for a while now.
it seems to be most prominent in the prostate or rectum during bowel movements, not at the exit. (although i do get hemeroids)
my intestines do also feel unpleasant afterwards.

i have also had a tender abdomen for quite a while now, wearing belts is very uncomfortable when its flaring up.

its a pretty intense (9/10 on the worst days) nausiating pain, definately the worst pain ive experienced. its not a sharp pain, just very overwhelming.

its usually the worst in the mornings

i usually take 20-30 minutes to recover in bed after the most painfull bowel movements.

i struggle a lot to eat enough, eating is a challenge and tedious and just something i have to do regularly otherwise i feel worse. i dont really feel the urge to eat, and im pretty skinny, although i dont think ive gained or lost much weight over time.

i do also experience constipation, and struggle to get it all out at once, even though i also get diahrea frequently, i guess its just too much pain to do it in one go sometimes.

i am lactose intolerant, but that usually just gives me bloating (which also does suck, passing gass is painfull).
i have bigger triggers though:
mostly, extreme stress, masturbation, and any at all personal rectal inspection.

additionally, the tube that connects the testicles to the body frequently inflames on the right side, and becomes extremely tender and hurts to touch.
it aches for a while.
most of my abdominal tenderness is located on my right side.

i have had a ct scan done on my abdomen, and there were no issues with my appendix other than it being on the large side.

i dont really have trouble peeing, i do struggle to get it all out occasionally, and the skin near the tip of my penis seems thin, and is painfull infrequently.

recently, i have noticed a "bulge" in the muscles diagonal to my groin (about a 30Â° angle upwards), its not clearly visible from the eye.

it doesnt usually hurt when i cough, it does hurt a little when i walk however.

probably irrelevant, but i require much more sleep than normal people to feel good during the day, at least 8 hours, and recently have been very fatigued and feel like my body is forcing me to rest, even if i dont want to. this is probably just a stress thing though.

i miiight have an abdominal migrane, i do feel a pit in my stomach, lower down and more centralized that does feel like it lines up with a few of the symptoms, during stressfull bowel movements.

while i dont have the greatest memory, the worst pain ive had was a few years ago, where i would be breathing heavily and doing anything to distract myself and make the pain away when i went to the bathroom. it'd happen one a week on average and felt like i was going to die.
i think over time as ive more accepted my symptoms and become more calm in the bathroom its been much easier to deal with, and i think i expirience lesser pain.
although it still gets bad sometimes.

definetly more than just a stress reaction, though.

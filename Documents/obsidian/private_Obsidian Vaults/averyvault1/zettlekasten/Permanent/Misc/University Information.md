to take a class in a German university as a non German student you have to attend a Studienkolleg, b2 minimum speaking level (the Engineering class is usually the T class).
you also (at least in Badden Wurtemburg) have to pay a 1500 dollar fee per semester (i think a semester is 6 months, half a year).
You Will Have To Know German, classes are taught in German.
the university language course takes between 1 and 2 years to learn, and you can apply without necasarilly going to the college there.
when you take a Studienkolleg you should call the colleges you apply to to see if they will accept your Studienkolleg.
you also need a highschool diploma.
The total cost of living is around 900-1000 euro a month.
Expensive! half of it is rent, ~500 a month but its cheaper in dorm living.
there are church dorms for like everyone and also you could bunk with someone for cheap.
They might remove the 1500 euro american tax but you could also just take college somewhere else.
theres also a 116 euro fee but who gives a Fuck.
Karlsruhe (KIT) and Mannheim and Munchen () are maybe good options for college

General information:

All international applicants for undergraduate studies must fulfill two basic requirements: They must have a higher-education entrance qualification and sufficient German language proficiency. Additionally, subject-specific requirements may apply.

In assessing qualifications gained in non-German educational institutions, Heidelberg University follows the regulations of the “Zentralstelle für ausländisches Bildungswesen” (Central Office for Foreign Education (ZAB)).  An overview of the relevant regulations can be found at [http://anabin.kmk.org](http://anabin.kmk.org) (“Schulabschlüsse mit Hochschulzugang“- „Suche“ in the center of the page – select the country where you obtained your higher-education entrance qualification, i.e. _Baccalauréat_, GCE - A & O Levels, school-leaving certificate, university entrance examination, etc. Detailed information will appear upon clicking on the name of the relevant degree.). The DAAD also offers a database on admission requirements in English: [https://www.daad.de/en/study-and-research-in-germany/plan-your-studies/admission-database/](https://www.daad.de/en/study-and-research-in-germany/plan-your-studies/admission-database/).

The language of instruction in all undergraduate programmes at Heidelberg University is German. Accordingly, students must be proficient in German when they begin their studies. In order to be able to enroll in a German-taught subject, admitted applicants must meet the relevant language requirements. In some cases, sufficient German language proficiency must be proven before enrolment as part of the application to a course of study. Further information available at: [https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study/international-studies/language-requirements-for-international-students](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study/international-studies/language-requirements-for-international-students).

Studienkolleg:

A Studienkolleg helps students prepare for the assessment test (Feststellungsprüfung). At the Studienkolleg of Heidelberg University students are provided with subject-field specific preparatory courses. The preparatory courses run for two semesters.

Prospective students who wish to join the Studienkolleg must apply to Heidelberg University for admission to a course at the Studienkolleg in due time and form. This occurs via our online platform, heiCO, [https://heico.uni-heidelberg.de/heiCO/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/login](https://heico.uni-heidelberg.de/heiCO/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/login), where all required documents need to be uploaded.

The application period for the winter semester begins on May 1st and ends on June 30th of the same year.

The application period for the summer semester usually begins on November 1st and ends on December 15th of the previous year.

Please be aware that, in order to be admitted to the Studienkolleg, prospective students will need to provide proof of good German-language skills. Applicants are required to present a certificate of having successfully completed German-language courses at the level of B2 of the Common European Framework of Languages.

Students who are assigned to a preparatory course of the Studienkolleg of Heidelberg University must take an entrance examination (German language proficiency test). The result determines whether the applicant will be admitted to the preparatory course or not. A sample of this test can be found at [https://www.isz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/entrance-stk-ksk](https://www.isz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/entrance-stk-ksk).

You will find further information on the application process as well as on the necessary requirements at [https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study/application-enrolment/requirements-for-enrolment/assessment-test-feststellungsprufung-in-a-preparatory-course-studienkolleg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study/application-enrolment/requirements-for-enrolment/assessment-test-feststellungsprufung-in-a-preparatory-course-studienkolleg). There you can also find an overview of the respective Studienkolleg courses in order to find out which one of them (G, M, S, T, W) is required to study a specific undergraduate degree programme.

German classes offered by Heidelberg University:

The Kolleg für deutsche Sprache und Kultur of the university’s Internationales Studienzentrum (ISZ) offers intensive German language courses with a minimum of 20 hours of instruction per week at various levels (elementary, intermediate and advanced; A1-C1). The German language courses are intended for prospective students who wish to improve their German language proficiency before applying to a course of study (Bachelor’s/State Exam or Master’s degree programmes) or the Studienkolleg.

In order to be able to apply for one of the German language courses the applicant must have a higher-education entrance qualification. Please note that, as a rule, students without any knowledge of German need three semesters of language classes before they reach the level required for a study programme.

Students who wish to learn German for one or two semesters before applying for a place in a degree programme (undergraduate or graduate) must apply directly to the ISZ.

Information on the application process as well as the course fees can be found at [https://www.isz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/ksk](https://www.isz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/ksk).

If you have specific questions about the German course, please contact the ISZ directly. Contact information can be found at: [https://www.isz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/ksk?overlay=contact](https://www.isz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/ksk?overlay=contact).

For subject-specific questions you can always contact the subject-specific counsellor of the desired subject.

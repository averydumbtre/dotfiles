**English** is a [West Germanic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germanic_language "West Germanic language") that emerged in [early medieval England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_medieval_England "Early medieval England") and has since become a global [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca "Lingua franca").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThe_Routes_of_English-4)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrystal2003a6-5)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWardhaugh201055-6) The namesake of the language is the [Angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles_\(tribe\) "Angles (tribe)"), one of the [Germanic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples "Germanic peoples") who [migrated to Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_settlement_of_Britain "Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain") after the [end of Roman rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_Roman_rule_in_Britain "End of Roman rule in Britain"). English is the [most spoken language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_spoken_language "Most spoken language") in the world, primarily due to the global influences of the former [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire") (succeeded by the [Commonwealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations")) and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"). It is the most widely learned [second language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_language "Second language") in the world, with more second-language speakers than native speakers. However, English is only the [third-most spoken native language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers "List of languages by number of native speakers"), after [Mandarin Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese "Mandarin Chinese") and [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-Ethnologue26-3)

English is either the official language, or one of the official languages, in [57 sovereign states and 30 dependent territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_where_English_is_an_official_language "List of countries and territories where English is an official language"), making it the most geographically widespread language in the world. In the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia"), and [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand"), it is the dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTECrystal2003b108–109-7) It is a [co-official language of the United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_languages_of_the_United_Nations "Official languages of the United Nations"), the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union), and many other international and regional organisations. It has also become the de facto [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca "Lingua franca") of diplomacy, [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_science "Languages of science"), technology, international trade, [logistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics "Logistics"), tourism, aviation, entertainment, and the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_used_on_the_Internet "Languages used on the Internet").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-8) _[Ethnologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnologue "Ethnologue")_ estimated that there were over 1.4 billion speakers worldwide as of 2021.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-Ethnologue26-3)

[Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the [Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons "Anglo-Saxons"). Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse "Old Norse"), a [North Germanic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Germanic_language "North Germanic language").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-Finkenstaedt1973-9)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBammesberger199230-10)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTESvartvikLeech200639-11) Then, [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English "Middle English") borrowed vocabulary extensively from [French dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langues_d%27o%C3%AFl "Langues d'oïl"), which are the source of approximately [28 percent of Modern English words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_French_origin "List of English words of French origin"), and from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"), which is [the source of an additional 28 percent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_words_with_English_derivatives "List of Latin words with English derivatives").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language#cite_note-12) While Latin and the [Romance languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages "Romance languages") are thus the source for a majority of its lexicon taken as a whole, English grammar and phonology retain a family resemblance with the Germanic languages, and most of its basic everyday vocabulary remains Germanic in origin. English exists on a [dialect continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum "Dialect continuum") with [Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language "Scots language"); it is next-most closely related to [Low Saxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_German "Low German") and [Frisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisian_languages "Frisian languages").

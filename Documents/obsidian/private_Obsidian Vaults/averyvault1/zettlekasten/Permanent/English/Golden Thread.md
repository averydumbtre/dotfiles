Golden thread, as explained by Ms.Ask is when you are writing about something trying to make a simple point, that at the end points to something greater, usually a large philosophical message.

e.g 
"The restriction of sex in 1984 adds to the dystopic theme of the book, **this proves that sex fucking rules and is a force for good**"

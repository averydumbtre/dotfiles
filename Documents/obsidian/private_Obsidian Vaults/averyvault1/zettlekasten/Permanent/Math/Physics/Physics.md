**Physics** is the [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific "Scientific") study of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), its [fundamental constituents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle"), its [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion "Motion") and behavior through [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"), and the related entities of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") and [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#cite_note-maxwell1878-physicalscience-1) It is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#cite_note-youngfreedman2014p1-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#cite_note-youngfreedman2014p2-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#cite_note-holzner2003-physics-4) A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist").

Physics is one of the oldest [academic disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline "Academic discipline").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#cite_note-krupp2003-5) Over much of the past two millennia, physics, [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"), and certain branches of mathematics were a part of [natural philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy"), but during the [Scientific Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution "Scientific Revolution") in the 17th century, these natural sciences branched into separate research endeavors. Physics intersects with many [interdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity "Interdisciplinarity") areas of research, such as [biophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics "Biophysics") and [quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry "Quantum chemistry"), and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#cite_note-youngfreedman2014p1-2) and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.

Advances in physics often enable new [technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"). For example, advances in the understanding of [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism "Electromagnetism"), [solid-state physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_physics "Solid-state physics"), and [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics "Nuclear physics") led directly to the development of technologies that have transformed modern society, such as television, computers, [domestic appliances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_appliance "Domestic appliance"), and [nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon "Nuclear weapon");(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics#cite_note-youngfreedman2014p1-2) advances in [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") led to the development of industrialization; and advances in [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics") inspired the development of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus").

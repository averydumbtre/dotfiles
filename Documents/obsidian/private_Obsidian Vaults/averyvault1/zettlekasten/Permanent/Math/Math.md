**Mathematics** is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_theory "Mathematical theory") and [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem") that are developed and [proved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof "Mathematical proof") for the needs of [empirical sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_sciences "Empirical sciences") and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics, which include [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory "Number theory") (the study of numbers), [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra") (the study of formulas and related structures), [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis "Mathematical analysis") (the study of continuous changes), and [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory") (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics).

Mathematics involves the description and manipulation of [abstract objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object "Mathematical object") that consist of either [abstractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_\(mathematics\) "Abstraction (mathematics)") from nature or—in modern mathematics—purely abstract entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom"). Mathematics uses pure [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason") to [prove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_\(mathematics\) "Proof (mathematics)") properties of objects, a _proof_ consisting of a succession of applications of [deductive rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_rule "Inference rule") to already established results. These results include previously proved [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem"), axioms, and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics#cite_note-1)

Mathematics is essential in the [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine"), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance "Finance"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), and the [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences "Social sciences"). Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent of any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") and [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory "Game theory"), are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under [applied mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics"). Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called [pure mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics "Pure mathematics")) but often later find practical applications.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPeterson198812-2)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics#cite_note-wigner1960-3)

Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated [mathematical rigour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_rigour "Mathematical rigour") first appeared in [Greek mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mathematics "Greek mathematics"), most notably in [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid "Euclid")'s _[Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements "Euclid's Elements")_.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics#cite_note-4) Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") (the manipulation of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") and [fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractions "Fractions")), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics#cite_note-5) and [infinitesimal calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_calculus "Infinitesimal calculus") were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and [scientific discoveries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_discoveries "Timeline of scientific discoveries") has led to a correlated increase in the development of both.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics#cite_note-6) At the end of the 19th century, the [foundational crisis of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundational_crisis_of_mathematics "Foundational crisis of mathematics") led to the systematization of the [axiomatic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_method "Axiomatic method"),(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics#cite_note-Kleiner_1991-7) which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary [Mathematics Subject Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_Subject_Classification "Mathematics Subject Classification") lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.

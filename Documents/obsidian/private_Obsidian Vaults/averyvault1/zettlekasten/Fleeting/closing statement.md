jason fucking left his kids to have sex with another woman
* did not take the kids away from medea earlier when he really should have
* kids are his, he made him, they are his responsibility and under his custody
    * did he devorce medea? no.
* pedagogue is his slave, interacted with him and knows that medea is going to kill her kids
    * probably told him
* he knows medea like loves to kill people in her own family
* the chorus is just the public and they know that medea is gonna kill her kids
    * the word of the people probbbably makes it to the king. lol
* tha word is out!!

* the pedagogue gossips
    * to the nurse
    * listens to people in public and knows about medea
    * knows medea wants to kill her kids
    * should have spread the word to the royal house pretty fast
    * knows that jason "doesnt care about his kids" so he probably has known that they are in a bad position and isnt doing anything
only when she was being dumped out of his country did he even start to think about how he should take care of his kids.



what did the other team say that was stupid and could help us?

why the law says im right (IF JASON DID HIS THING AND WAS A NORMAL HUMAN BEING AND KEPT TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS WITH THE INFINITE MONEY HE HAS INSTEAD OF LEAVING THEM WITH A HOMICIDAL WOMAN. THAT WOULD BE COOL)

quotes?

what the witness said.



(optional?)
Your Honor, my name is Avery Rude, representing the prosecution in this case.
Jason, as some of you may have noticed, is an asshole.
Now under our current law, unfortunately you cant prosecute someone for being an asshole;
But. you can prosecute them for the criminal actions they have committed that led up to them being an asshole, such as caring so little about his own children that he left them to die by his homicidal wife's hand. The Evidence has Shown, not only did Jason leave Medea to have-, pursue his interests with another woman, leaving his kids behind. He clearly had the money and power to take care of them, or pay someone to do so. It was common knowledge that Medea was not properly caring for her children, even going so far as to threaten their lives! Being married to the kings daughter, he really should have heard this news about his own kids, and yet he didn't act upon it until it was far too late. That's why it shouldn't be too surprising that people knew he didn't like his kids, only when she was being dumped out of his country did he even start to think about his duties as a father. Now this wouldn't be illegal, again you cant prosecute on assholishness, however his neglect for his own children did lead to a serious crime.
Their deaths.
Jason should serve the sentence of 2 cases of Criminally Negligent Homicide, one for each of his children of whom he didn't do the due diligence of giving a good home.

* pedagogue is his slave, interacted with him and knows that medea is going to kill her kids

    * to the nurse
    * listens to people in public and knows about medea
    * knows medea wants to kill her kids
    * should have spread the word to the royal house pretty fast
    * knows that jason "doesnt care about his kids" so he probably has known that they are in a bad position and isnt doing anything

### pedagogue questions



h![[Pasted image 20251019160817.png]]ow long have you tended to the kids?

 how frequently do you play with the kids, away from medea?

have you ever taken the kids a great distance away from medea?

what do you know about jasons relationship with his kids?

has jason married another woman?

what do you know about medeas relationship with her kids?

do you know how much money jason has?

.

so, jason, not caring much about his kids left them with medea (who hates them). despite having a slave fully capable of transporting them, a wife who could mother them, or the money to afford some sort of other care.

should have taken the kids earlier,
pedagogue says he doesnt really care about the kids. which is fucked up. he did not divorce medea, he just left the kids in her care, which is criminaly negligant. the pedagogue is jasons slave and has been tending to the kids with medea instead of taking them to jason, which he is capable of doing?
